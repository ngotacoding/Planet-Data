# Kaggle - Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space

## Introduction:
This repository contains code and data for the Kaggle competition "Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space." The goal of this competition is to create a multi-label classification model to label satellite images of the Amazon rainforest, identifying various land cover types and human-made features.

## Dataset:
All the data required for this competition is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data). The dataset includes satellite images in the form of JPEG files, and each image is associated with multiple labels representing land cover categories (e.g., primary rainforest, agriculture, water bodies, roads, etc.). The training data contains labeled examples for model training, while the test data is used for evaluation purposes during the competition.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies and libraries installed (Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.).
3. Open the "planet-dataset.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

## Instructions:
1. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load and explore the data, perform necessary preprocessing, and build the multi-label classification model.
2. Train the model using the provided training data and optimize the hyperparameters as needed.
3. Make predictions on the test data to generate the submission file for the Kaggle competition.
4. Submit your results on the Kaggle competition page and compare your performance with other participants.
